Scan Network using ARP Requests 

## Explanation of Network Scanning
A Network Scanner is an Important element for a network administrator as well as a penetration tester. It allows the user to map the network to find devices that are connected to the same network.

There are many ways out there to scan computers in a single network, but this tool uses one of the popular ways which is **_ARP_** request.
> _The Network Scanner Will Send ARP Request Indicating who has Some specific IP Addtess, Let's Say "192.168.1.1", the owner of that IP address(Target) will automatically respond Saying that he is " 192.168.1.1", with that response, the MAC Address will also be included in the packet, this allows the tool to successfully retrieve all networks user's IP and MAC Addresses._
> _Simultaneously when the user send a broadcast packet(sending a packet to all the devices in the network)._
